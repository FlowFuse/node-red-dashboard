# Radio Group `ui-radio-group`

</TryDemo>

Adds a Radio Group to your dashboard that will emit values in Node-RED under `msg.payload` anytime a value is selected.

## Programmatic Selections

You can dynamically make selections for this dropdown by passing in the respective `value` to `msg.payload`, e.g. `msg.payload = "option1"`.

### Clear Selection

 To clear any selection for a dropdown, pass an empty string `""` as `msg.payload`.
