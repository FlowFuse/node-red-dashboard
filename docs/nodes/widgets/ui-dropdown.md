# Dropdown `ui-dropdown`

</TryDemo>

Adds a dropdown to your dashboard that will emit values in Node-RED under `msg.payload` anytime it's value is changed.

## Programmatic Selections

You can dynamically make selections for this dropdown by passing in the respective `value` to `msg.payload`.

### Single Selection

To make a single selection, pass in the `value` of the option as `msg.payload`, e.g. `msg.payload = "option1"`.

### Multi-Selection

 To make a multi-selection selection, you must first have "Allow Multiple" enabled on the node, you can then pass an Array of `value` of the respective options as `msg.payload`, e.g. `msg.payload = ["option1", "option2"]`.

### Clear Selection

 To clear any selection for a dropdown, pass an empty array `[]` as `msg.payload`.
