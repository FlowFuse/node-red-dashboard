description: Display and manage complex datasets with ease using the ui-table widget in Node-RED Dashboard 2.0.
props:
    Group: Defines which group of the UI Dashboard this widget will render in.
    Size: Controls the width of the button with respect to the parent group. Maximum value is the width of the group.
    Label: The text shown above the table, labelling what the table is showing.
    Max Rows: Defines the maximum number of data-rows to render in the table. Excess rows will be available through pagination control. Set to "0" for no pagination.
    Breakpoint: Controls when a table will render, instead, as a card, with each column from a row rendering as a row in a larger, contain a row, for a single entry.The breakpoint is measured based on the <b>width of the table</b>, not the width of the screen.
    Selection: Provides three options for table interaction - "None", "Click" and "Checkbox"
    Show Search: Defines whether or not to show a search bar above the table. Will permit searching and filtering across all columns.
    Auto Columns: If checked, then the columns are calculated automatically based on the contents of received messages.
    Columns: If "Auto Columns" is false, then these columns are used when rendering the table instead.

# Data Table `ui-table` <AddedIn version="0.4.0" />

</TryDemo>

## Sending Data

Renders a set of data in a tabular format. Expects an input (`msg.payload`) in the format of:

```json
[{
    "colA": "A",
    "colB": "Hello",
    "colC": 3
}, {
    "colA": "B",
    "colB": "World",
    "colC": 5
}]
```

The table will be rendered with columns `colA`, `colB` and `colC`, unless "Columns" are explicitly defined on the node, with "Auto Columns" toggled off.

You can also send a single piece of data to append to the existing table, in this case, the `ui-table` expects an input (`msg.payload`) in the format of:

```json
{
    "colA": "A",
    "colB": "Hello",
    "colC": 3
}
```

### Clear Data

You can send an empty array to clear the table.

```json
[]
```

## Properties

<PropsTable/>

### Selection

- **None**: No selection is allowed. The table will just display the data.
- **Click**: The full row becomes a clickable entity, and the `ui-table` node will _output the full object_ associated to a row when clicked.
- **Checkbox**: Each row has a checkbox, and the `ui-table` node will _output an array of objects_ associated to the checked rows when a checkbox is selected.


The respective events will output the following:

```json
{
    "payload": <full row object>,
    "action": "row_click" | "multiselect"
}
```

You can also add a [Button](#interaction-buttons) cell type and have events emitted that way too.

### Responsiveness <AddedIn version="1.15.0" />

The _"Breakpoint"_ property for UI table gives you control over when a table will switch to "mobile" mode, and render reach row of data as a card. This is useful when you have a lot of columns, and the table is too wide to fit on a mobile screen. The breakpoint is measured based on the **width of the table**, not the width of the screen.

![Mobile View of the same UI Table](/images/node-examples/ui-table-responsiveness-mobile.png)
_Mobile View of the same UI Table_

The breakpoint can be defined in one of three ways:

- **defaults**: Select from one of the predefined breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg).
- **px**: Manually define a `px` value that the table will switch to mobile mode at once it breaches that width.
- **none**: Always render as rows of data in a table, never switch to "Mobile" view.

### Configuring Columns

_Screenshot of the configuration options available for column types in Node-RED_

If you toggle "off" the "Auto Columns" option, you will have more control to define the columns for your table. For each column, you can define the following:

- **Value**: The value to use for rendering the control. Typically, you would provide a key to the value in the data row object but it can be changed to provide a fixed string value.
- **Label**: The text to display in the column header.
- **Width**: The width of the column, can be in `px`, `%`, or any other valid CSS sizing.
- **Align:** The alignment of the text in the column. Can be `Left`, `Center`, or `Right`. Note that some columns do look odd with "Center" alignment as the header does also contain space for the sorting icon.
- **Type**: Defines the cell's type and controls how your data will be rendered for this column.

### Cell Types <AddedIn version="1.10.0" />

_An example of a ui-table displaying various of the cell types available_

- **Text**: Renders the cell as plain text.
- **HTML**: Will respect new line breaks (e.g. `\n`) and basic HTML tags.
- **Link**: Renders the cell as a hyperlink. The `Link` field should contain the URL to link to.
- **Color**: Renders the cell as a colored box. The `Color` field should contain a valid CSS color.
- **Tick/Cross**: Renders the cell as a tick or cross. The `Value` field should contain a boolean (`true`/`false`) value.
- **Progress**: Renders the cell as a progress bar. The `Value` field should contain a number between 0 and 100.
- **Sparkline - Trend**: Renders the cell as a small line chart without axes. The `Value` field should contain an array of numbers to be plotted.
- **Sparkline - Bar**: Renders the cell as a small bar chart without axes. The `Value` field should contain an array of numbers to be plotted.
- **Button**: Renders a clickable button in the cell. The label of the button will be either the `row[key]` or the fixed string entered on the manual column configuration.
- **Row Number**: Renders the row number into the cell.
- **Image**: Renders the cell as an image. The "Image" value provided should be a valid URL.  A data url is also supported for base64 encoded images. When an invalid url is specified, an empty space will appear.

#### Interaction: Buttons

The `Button` cell type will render a clickable button in the cell. The label of the button will be the corresponding value in your row for the provided `key`. When the button is clicked, the `ui-table` node will output:

```
{
    "payload": <full row object>
    "column": <column key>
    "action": "button_click"
}
```

Given the `action` and `column` keys, you can determine which button was clicked and use the `payload` to determine which row it was associated with.

#### Example

<FlowViewer :flow="examples['cellTypes']" height="200px"/>

## Dynamic Properties

<DynamicPropsTable/>

## Table Configuration

### Search & Filter

The `ui-table` node can be configured to include a search bar above the table. This will allow users to search and filter across all columns, and automatically search across all columns when you type.

#### Example

![Example of a Data Table with Search & Filter](/images/node-examples/ui-table-search.png "Example of a Data Table with Search & Filter"){data-zoomable}

### Interaction

Example that show how a table will appear with different selection types chosen.

#### Default - No Selection Events

#### Multi-Selection
![Example of a table that has "Multi Selection" enabled](/images/node-examples/ui-table-multi.png "Example of a table that has 'Multi Selection' enabled"){data-zoomable}

#### Single Row Selection

### Pagination

![Example of a Paginated Table](/images/node-examples/ui-table-pagination.png "Example of a Paginated Table"){data-zoomable}
*Example of a paginated table which has 10 rows of data, but with "Max Rows" set to 5.*

If you want to hide the pagination ("Items per page") options, then you can set "Max Rows" to 0.

## Custom Styling & Content

If you're looking to add more customisation to how your data is rendered, you can do so by building your own data table inside a `ui-template`. Check out [this example](../../user/template-examples.md#custom-tables) for more details.
