This widget allows users to add a simple spacer to their dashboard groups, aiding with element layout.

## Properties

<PropsTable/>


## Current Limitations

_Currently_
* the spacer widgets belong to the global flow and are not exported along with the group unless the entire flow is exported. This means that if you want to export a group with spacer widgets, you will need to either export the entire flow or add the spacer widgets manually after importing the group.
* Editing a spacer is only possible on the Dashboard 2.0 sidebar and not from the the Node-RED config sidebar.

## Using the Spacer Widget

From the Dashboard 2.0 sidebar, hover over the group you want to add the spacer to and click the `â†” spacer` button. This will add a spacer to the group that you can then drag to the desired location. Opening the spacer's edit dialog will allow you to set the size of the spacer.
