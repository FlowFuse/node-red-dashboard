# Notification `ui-notification` <AddedIn version="0.5.0" />

<TryDemo href="notification" />

Known in Dashboard 1.0 as a "Toast", this widget displays text/HTML in a small window that will appear on the screen for a defined duration of time (`timeout`) and at a defined location on the screen (`position`).

If you want to have the notification show indefinitely, you can set `timeout` to `0`. It will not be possible to close the notification manually unless you also set `allowDismiss` or `allowConfirm` to `true`.

## Example

![Example of rendered Notification](/images/node-examples/ui-notification.png "Example of rendered Notification"){data-zoomable}
*Example of rendered Notification in a Dashboard with a progress bar showing how long left until it will automatically close.*

This notification was created using a `msg.payload` of:

```html
<h3>Generated Notification</h3><p>This is custom HTML injected into <b>Node-RED</b></p>
```

### Sending to all clients

Notifications are, by default, constrained to send to a single user/client. In Dashboard 2.0 this constraint is defined by `msg._client`. You can read more about this [here](../../user/multi-tenancy.md#configuring-client-data).

If you want to send a notification to _all_ connected clients, you can remove the `msg._client` value using a "change" node, configured to "Delete" the `_client` property.
