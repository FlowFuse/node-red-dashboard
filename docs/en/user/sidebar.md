The Dashboard 2.0 sidebar tab is added to the Node-RED sidebar. It is designed to provide a quick overview of the current state of the Dashboard, and support in the overall configuration of the Dashboard.

## Sidebar Tabs

### Layout

Provides an overview of all pages, links, groups and widgets configured for the respective Dashboard. From here you can re-order, re-group and edit any of these elements. There are also shortcuts to "+ Link", "+ Page" and "+ Group" to quickly add new structural elements to the Dashboard.

### Theming

Every page in the Dashboard can have a different theme applied to it. This tab provides an overview of all themes defined on the Dashboard, and allows you to edit or create new themes.

Each theme details how many pages are actively using that theme at present, and a preview of the colour palette used to help differentiate between themes.

### Client Data <AddedIn version="1.10.0" />

Dashboard 2.0 can append data to every `msg` a node emits that details information on the user/client interacting with the Dashboard.

#### Include Client Data

Defines whether or not any client data is being appended to messages emitted by the Dashboard. If on, then a new `msg._client` value will be available to you which the relevant data included.

You will also find a list here of "Data providers" that are currently active in the Dashboard. In addition to the core provider (which provides `msg._client.socketId`), it will list any plugins that have declared `auth: true` in their `index.html` file (see [Plugins docs](../contributing/plugins/index.md) for more information)

#### Accepts Client Data

Here, on a widget type-by-type basis, you can define whether or not a node will utilise any `msg._client` data passed to it. 

For nodes that have this set, a `msg` injected into the node containing a `_client` object, will only be sent to the respective client. For example, a specific socket connection of `msg._client.socketId` is provided, or a specific user if a `msg._client.user` is provided by a plugin.

If you have checked this on for a node type, but want to send a message to all connections still, make sure you have removed the `msg._client` object from the message before sending. This can be done using a `change` node with a `delete` operation on the `msg._client` object.
