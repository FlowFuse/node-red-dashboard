# Layouts

Layouts are a configuration available on a page-by-page basis. They control how all of the [Groups](../nodes/config/ui-group) of widgets are laid out on a given [Page](../nodes/config/ui-page):

We currently offer four different layout options:

- [Grid](./types/grid.md)
- [Fixed](./types/fixed.md)
- [Notebook](./types/notebook.md)
- [Tabs](./types/tabs.md)

## Sizing Groups & Widgets

A fundamental component of building out layouts in FlowFuse Dashboard (which follows the Node-RED Dashboard principle) is the ability to control the size of each group and widget with the size selection widget:

Exactly what this sizing means does differ slightly depending on the layout you're using, but the general principle is that the size of a group or widget will control how much space it takes up in the layout. 

The core differences are in the "width" property of the size:

- For "Grid" and "Notebook", the width is calculated as a portion of 12 _columns_, i.e. a width of "6", would take up half of the width of the layout.
- For "Fixed", the width is calculated as a multiple of 90 _pixels_, i.e. a width of "3", would take up 270px of the screen.

## Breakpoints

Most layouts in Dashboard utilise a concept of "Columns", whereby the group width is defined as a number of columns, e.g. 6, and the page then renders a given number of columns too, e.g. 12. This means that a group with a width of 6 would take up half of the page's width.

Breakpoints [can be configured](../nodes/config/ui-page.md#breakpoints) on a page-by-page basis, controlling how many columns are rendered at different screen sizes. This is particularly useful for responsive design, allowing you to control how many columns are rendered on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop.

## Theme Options

In addition to the core layout structure, defining how the groups are ordered and laid out, it is also possible to control some of the spacing in a layout through the page's [Theme](../nodes/config/ui-theme).

### Configurable Options

Each color here correlates to the respective section in the following image:

- **Page Padding:** The spacing that encapsulates the full page's content, depicted above as the <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> space.
- **Group Gap:** The spacing between each group, depicted above as the <span style="color: lightseagreen;">green</span> space.
- **Widget Gap:** The spacing between each widget, within a group, depicted above as the <span style="color: deeppink;">pink</span> space.

An additional option available on a group-by-group basis is whether or not to show the Group's name, above depicted by the <span style="color: goldenrod;">yellow</span> space. If this is hidden, the Group Padding (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>), will render on all four sides of the group.

### Not Configurable (Currently)

Whilst we do offer reasonable levels of customization, there are some areas not currently configurable:

- **Row Height:** A single unit of height is currently fixed at 48px. This cannot be changed at this time. This also affects the "Fixed" layout, where a single unit of width is driven by this value.
- **Group Padding:** The spacing that encapsulates the full group's content, depicted above as the <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> space.
