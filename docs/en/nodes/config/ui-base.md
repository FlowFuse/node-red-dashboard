# Config: UI Base `ui-base`

## Properties

<PropsTable :hide-dynamic="true"/>

## Application Icon <AddedIn version="1.18.0" />

The **Application Icon** feature allows you to set a custom icon for your FlowFuse Dashboard. This icon is used in the browser tab and when installing the dashboard as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The image provided should be a square with dimensions between **192px and 512px**. To set it up, provide a URL to an image in the App Icon field, enhancing branding and user recognition.

#### To configure the Application Icon feature in FlowFuse Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Open the Edit ui-base node settings.
2. In the App Icon field, enter the URL of the image you want to use as your app icon. Ensure the image is square, with dimensions between 192px and 512px.
3. This icon will be displayed in the browser tab and when the dashboard is installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
4. Click Update to save the changes.

## Allow Install <AddedIn version="1.23.0" />

It is possible to install any FlowFuse Dashboard applications as a Progressive Web App onto a desktop or mobile device, giving the appearance and user-experience of a native mobile application. You can read more about that functionality [here](../../user/pwa.md).

The "Allow Install" option provides the capability to enable/disable the option to "Install" your Dashboard as an application. If you are using FlowFuse authentication, this is not recommended, as the PWA workers cache content separate from authentication sessions.

## Header Style Options <AddedIn version="1.10.0" />

### Title Bar - Default

The title bar will appear as the first element, and scroll _with_ the content, meaning that on longer pages, the title bar will not be visible when the page is scrolled.

### Title Bar - Fixed

The title bar will _always_ be visible, even when the page is scrolled. This is useful for when you want to always have access to the title bar, regardless of the page's length.

### Title Bar - Hidden

The title bar is not visible at all. Note that it is still possible to see the navigation menu in this state by choosing the [Fixed](#fixed) option.

## Header Content Options <AddedIn version="1.10.0" />

Defines the text that is shown in the main page title.

### Page Name

This will show the active page's name. Between each page change, this will be updated to reflect the new page's name.

### Dashboard Name

This will use the Dashboard's name, and be consistent across all pages in your application.

### Dashboard Name (Page Name)

This will combine the previous two options, and display both the Dashboard name and Page name, with the latter inside brackets.

### None

There will be no text-based title shown. Often used in partnership with [Teleports](../../nodes/widgets/ui-template.md#teleports) in order to customise the content in this section, e.g. including logos.


## Navigation Style Options <AddedIn version="1.2.0" />

### Navigation - Collapsing (default)

<SideBySideImages
    caption="Example of how the 'Collapsing' option looks when open (left) and closed (right)."
    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-default-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-sidebar-closed.png"
/>

This open will shift the entire content of the Dashboard when opened, and not be visible at all when closed.

### Navigation - Fixed

![Example of how the 'Fixed' option looks at all times](/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-fixed.png "Example of how the 'Fixed' option looks at all times"){data-zoomable}
_Example of how the 'Fixed' option looks at all times_

Will always remain open. At our mobile breakpoint (768px), this value is overridden, and an "Appear Over" option is used. Note that at mobile-scale (screen width less than 768px), then the Fixed layout will revert back to the "Default" option.

### Navigation - Collapse to Icons

Similar to "Collapsing" when opened, but when closed, the icons for each page still show.

<SideBySideImages
    caption="Example of how the 'Collapsing' option looks when open (left) and closed (right)."
    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-default-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-icon-closed.png"
/>

### Navigation - Appear over Content

<SideBySideImages
    caption="Example of how the 'Collapsing' option looks when open (left) and closed (right)."
    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-over-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-sidebar-closed.png"
/>

Not visible when closed, and when open, will appear over the Dashboard content, without shifting it.

### Navigation - Always Hide

![Example of how the 'Always Hide' option looks](/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-hide.png "Example of how the 'Always Hide' option looks"){data-zoomable}

The sidebar will not be visible under any circumstances. All pages are still accessible via their direct links or a [ui-control](../widgets/ui-control.md) node.
