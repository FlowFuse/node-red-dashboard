# Config: UI Link `ui-link`

If you want to link to external resources from your Dashboard, you can do so with the `ui-link` config node. This will render a link in the side navigation menu, just like your Dashboard [Pages](./ui-page.md), but will navigate directly to the URL you specify, even if out of the scope of FlowFuse Dashboard.

## Properties

## Adding Links

To add a link to your Dashboard, you can use the Dashboard 2.0 side panel in the Node-RED editor. Click the `+ Link` button to add a new item to the list. You can then configure the link with the relevant properties.
