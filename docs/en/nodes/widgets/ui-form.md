# Form `ui-form`

</TryDemo>

Adds a form to user interface which helps to collect multiple value from the user on submit button click as an object in `msg.payload`.

### Populating Form Data

If you want to set defaults, or pre-fill values in your form, you can do so by passing a `msg.payload` value. This value should be an object, where each key represents the `key` of a form element, and the value represents the default value for that element.

Foe example, if you want to pre-fill a form with a "text" field, with a name, "first_name", you can pass the following `msg`:

```js
msg.payload = {
    "first_name": "John"
}
```

### Defining Form Elements (Options)

If you want to override the configuration for your `ui-form`, and provide details of your elements after your Node-RED flow has been deployed, you can do so by passing a `msg.ui_update.options` value. This value should be an array of objects, where each object represents a form element. Each object should have the following properties:

#### Element: Text

```json
{
    "type": "text",
    "label": "Name",
    "key": "name",
    "required": true
}
```

#### Element: Multiline

```json
{
    "type": "multiline",
    "label": "Name",
    "key": "name",
    "required": true,
    "rows": 4
}
```

#### Element: Password

```json
{
    "type": "password",
    "label": "Password",
    "key": "password",
    "required": true
}
```

#### Element: Email

```json
{
    "type": "email",
    "label": "E-Mail Address",
    "key": "email",
    "required": true
}
```

#### Element: Number

```json
{
    "type": "number",
    "label": "Age",
    "key": "age",
    "required": true
}
```

#### Element: Checkbox

```json
{
    "type": "checkbox",
    "label": "Subscribe to Newsletter",
    "key": "newsletter"
}
```

#### Element: Switch

```json
{
    "type": "switch",
    "label": "Enable Notifications",
    "key": "notifications"
}
```

#### Element: Date

```json
{
    "type": "date",
    "label": "Date of Birth",
    "key": "dob",
    "required": true
}
```

#### Element: Time

```json
{
    "type": "time",
    "label": "Time of Birth",
    "key": "tob",
    "required": true
}
```
#### Element: Dropdown

```json
{
    "type": "dropdown",
    "label": "Dropdown",
    "key": "selection"
}
```

### Defining Dropdown Options

If you want to override the configuration for your `ui-form`, and provide details of your dropdown options after your Node-RED flow has been deployed, you can do so by passing a `msg.ui_update.dropdownOptions` value. This value should be an array of objects, where each object represents a dropdown element. Each object should have the following properties:

```json
[{
    "dropdown": "Dropdown Name",
    "value": "1",
    "label": "Option 1"
}]
```
