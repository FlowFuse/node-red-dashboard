# Debugging FlowFuse Dashboard

FlowFuse Dashboard comes with a built-in debugging tool to understand the data being configured for each dashboard, page, theme, group and widget.

To navigate to the tooling, head to `<your-host>:<your-port>/dashboard/_debug`.

This tooling is particularly useful when you're building your own custom integrations, and developing on core Dashboard widgets too.

We're hoping to grow some of the scope of what this tooling provides, but for now, it will display the current `props` for a given widget, which is defined by Node-RED configurtion, but will also include the overriden values from the `msg` object (e.g. `msg.options` can override the `Options` property for a `ui-dropdown`).

## Message History

This tab will show the latest `msg` values that the associated node has received in Node-RED's `datastore` for a given widget. 

This is useful to understand what data will load when a new client connects to Node-RED. It will need refreshing to reflect the latest state if you're expecting new messages since the debug tool was last opened.

## Dynamic Properties

This tab shows any dynamic properties (properties set with an injection of a `msg.<property>` that have been set since the Node-RED server has been running. Within our server-side architecture, these are stored in our `statestore`. 

These values are generally overriding the default properties set within the Node-RED Editor, and can be used to sanity check why a particular widget renders the way that it does.
