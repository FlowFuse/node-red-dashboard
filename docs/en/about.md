# About FlowFuse Dashboard

Welcome to the documentation for the FlowFuse Dashboard (also known as Node-RED Dashboard 2.0), the successor to the original, and very popular,  [Node-RED Dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard).

This project was formed by [FlowFuse](https://flowfuse.com/), as part of efforts to upgrade the original Dashboard to steer away from Angular v1.0 which has long been deprecated. You can read our full statement about _why_ we're building FlowFuse Dashboard [here](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2023/06/dashboard-announcement/).

## Technologies

### Node-RED

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a flow-based programming tool, originally developed by IBM's Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the JS Foundation. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

### Vue.js v3.0

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web. It is a popular choice for building modern web applications.

We chose Vue.js over other popular frameworks like React and Angular because of its shallow learning curve, and ease of use/readability for non-front-end developers.

We also utilise the [Vuetify component library](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/all/), which is a Material Design component framework for Vue.js. It aims to provide clean, semantic and reusable components that make building your application a breeze.

### Socket IO

[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

In FlowFuse Dashboard we use Socket IO to communicate between Node-RED and the Dashboard UI.
